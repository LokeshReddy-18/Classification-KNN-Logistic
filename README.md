# Diabetes Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression
This repository contains Python code for performing diabetes classification using two machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression. The code also includes a comparison of the models' performance.

Data
The dataset used for this models is from {https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/diabetescsv}, which contains information about various health metrics and the presence or absence of diabetes.

Prerequisites
To run this code, you need the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

Usage
The Jupyter notebook contains code for:

Loading and exploring the dataset.
Data preprocessing, including handling missing values.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Scaling the features using StandardScaler.
Implementing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and a Logistic Regression model.
Calculating accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1-score for each model.
Visualizing the model performance using bar charts.
You can follow the code in the notebook to understand the steps and results in detail.

Results
The results of the two classification algorithms are compared in the notebook, including accuracy and F1-score. The results show how well the models performed in classifying diabetes outcomes based on the given health metrics.
